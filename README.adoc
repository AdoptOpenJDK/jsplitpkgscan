This project contains a proposal for a split package scanner tool http://openjdk.java.net[OpenJDK].

== Build and run
To build the tool you need to have a actual OpenJDK 9 build that you can get from https://jdk9.java.net[here].

In order to run gradle under the latest JDK 9 preview you need to set up the following environment variable:

[source, bash]
----
JAVA_OPTS='-XX:+IgnoreUnrecognizedVMOptions --permit-illegal-access --show-version'
----

Also add the following line to your `gradle.properties`:

[source, bash]
----
org.gradle.jvmargs=-XX:+IgnoreUnrecognizedVMOptions --permit-illegal-access --show-version
----

To build use:

[source, bash]
----
./gradlew clean build
----

After the build was sucessful you can now start it using:

[source, bash]
----
java -p build/libs -m jsplitpkg
----
